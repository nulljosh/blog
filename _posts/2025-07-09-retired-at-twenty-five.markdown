I woke up today without an alarm. No Slack pings. No Monday meetings. No looming deadlines. Just sunlight through the blinds and coffee on the stove.

Retired at twenty-five.

How? Let’s just say I paid attention when others were distracted. Took some calls most wouldn't. Read between lines. Moved fast when it mattered.

Now, the days feel different. Slower, but sharper. I walk more. Think more. Work? Only when I choose to. The rest—well, I’ll keep that part quiet.

See you around.
