# Stock Market Snapshot: 08:35 AM PDT, July 9, 2025

Yo, stock fam! It’s 08:35 AM PDT, July 9, 2025, and the market’s serving up some wild vibes.

**HOOD** is flexing at **$93.15**, up **2.05%**—bullish AF, straight fire!  
**NVDA** is riding high at **$163.11**, **+1.94%**—tech’s popping off like a rocket.  
**GRNY** and **NRG** are creeping up **0.27%** and **0.33%**—steady Eddies, nothing to scream about.  

Meanwhile:  
- **WMT** (-0.03%) and **PLTR** (-0.07%) are like, “Nah, we’re chilling.”  
- **DIS** (-0.53%) is taking a Disney-dumping hit.  
- **IBM** at **$289.01**, down **0.49%**—ouch, time to rethink that spreadsheet!

This mix of green and red got me eyeing **HOOD’s hustle**—feels like it’s primed for a $PLTR-level move (NFA, just vibes from the charts).

## PLTR & HOOD: Momentum Moves?

Digging deeper, **PLTR**’s showing some serious strength—bouncing off key support and reclaiming trendlines. Bulls are hyped, calling for targets at **$145** or even **$152** if it holds. X (formerly Twitter) is buzzing with *“confirmed breakout”* energy, though some folks are whispering a pullback might hit next week or end of July. The market looks ready for a breather after those parabolic pumps.

**HOOD’s** got that same *eerie similarity* vibe, with air to all-time highs and a wick to **$85** looking juicy. Traders are all about those buyable pullbacks, and I’m here for it—discounts like this scream opportunity, especially with **$TSLA** and **$PLTR** also dipping hard from their peaks.

## Final Take

So, what’s the play, crew?  
**HOOD** and **PLTR** are stealing the spotlight, and I’m tempted to load up while the fear’s peaking—6 months from now, we might be kicking ourselves if we sleep on this.

**NVDA**’s tech surge is a vibe, but those losers like **IBM** and **DIS** are giving me pause.
